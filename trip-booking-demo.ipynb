    "You have a task to setup an automated bot as a backend for your application to enable your users to book trips to the required destination by bus or by plane for a specific date. Users wants to communicate with a system in a natual language. System should be intelligent enough to gather missing information from the user, and automatically get this information from differen sources if required. When the trip is booked, agent need to find relevant information from internal documents about maximum baggage allowance and what will happen if the trip will be delayed, and include this information into the final response for the user.\n",

    "- `trip-terms` - folder with Markdown files with generated information for Flight terms and Bus terms. These are used in Knowledge base for RAG use-case.\n",
    "- `user-details-api` - folder with Python code for AWS Lambda function which is called for getting user details based on the user id, and OpenAPI schema for this Lambda function, so Agent for Amazon Bedrock can use this API as an Action Group.\n",

IMPORTANT: the functions provided within the examples should not be assumed to have been provided to you to use UNLESS they are also explicitly given to you within <functions></functions> tags below. All of the values and information within the examples (the questions, function results, and answers) are strictly part of the examples and have not been provided to you.\\n\\nNow that you have read and understood the examples, I will define the functions that you have available to you to use. Here is a comprehensive list.\\n\\n<functions>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId}</function_name>\\n<function_description>Retrieves user name and surname based on provided userID</function_description>\\n<required_argument>userId (string): Unique identifier of the user.</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Successful response with user details</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>POST::book-trip::/bookTrip</function_name>\\n<function_description>Allows a user to book a trip by providing necessary details.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>name (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>destination (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>date_of_trip (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>surname (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>transport_type (string):</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Booking confirmation response</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>user::askuser</function_name>\\n<function_description>Ask a user when you don't have parameter values for a function</function_description>\\n<required_argument>askuser (string): The information to ask from user</required_argument>\\n<returns>string: The information received from user</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_CMNZBRGMLX::Search</function_name>\\n<function_description>Here is information about general terms for trips by bus and airplane.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>searchQuery (string): A natural language query with all the necessary conversation context to query the search tool</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Returns string  related to the user query asked.</returns>\\n<raises>object: The predicted knowledge base doesn't exist. So, couldn't retrieve any information</raises><raises>object: Encountered an error in getting response from this function. Please try again later</raises>\\n</function>\\n\\n</functions>\\n\\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\nIf you are unsure of what one or more of the inputs to a function call should be, it\\u2019s completely all right to ask the user for more information. Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\\n\\nThe format for the askuser <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>user::askuser(askuser=\\\"$ASK_USER_INPUT\\\")</function_call>.\\n\\n\\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\\n\\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe user input is <question>I have a userid 2, do a booking of trip to Paris at 24 may 2024 by plane.</question>\\n\\n\\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\\n\\nTo answer this question, I will:\\n\\n1.

IMPORTANT: the functions provided within the examples should not be assumed to have been provided to you to use UNLESS they are also explicitly given to you within <functions></functions> tags below. All of the values and information within the examples (the questions, function results, and answers) are strictly part of the examples and have not been provided to you.\\n\\nNow that you have read and understood the examples, I will define the functions that you have available to you to use. Here is a comprehensive list.\\n\\n<functions>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId}</function_name>\\n<function_description>Retrieves user name and surname based on provided userID</function_description>\\n<required_argument>userId (string): Unique identifier of the user.</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Successful response with user details</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>POST::book-trip::/bookTrip</function_name>\\n<function_description>Allows a user to book a trip by providing necessary details.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>name (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>destination (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>date_of_trip (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>surname (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>transport_type (string):</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Booking confirmation response</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>user::askuser</function_name>\\n<function_description>Ask a user when you don't have parameter values for a function</function_description>\\n<required_argument>askuser (string): The information to ask from user</required_argument>\\n<returns>string: The information received from user</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_CMNZBRGMLX::Search</function_name>\\n<function_description>Here is information about general terms for trips by bus and airplane.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>searchQuery (string): A natural language query with all the necessary conversation context to query the search tool</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Returns string  related to the user query asked.</returns>\\n<raises>object: The predicted knowledge base doesn't exist. So, couldn't retrieve any information</raises><raises>object: Encountered an error in getting response from this function. Please try again later</raises>\\n</function>\\n\\n</functions>\\n\\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\nIf you are unsure of what one or more of the inputs to a function call should be, it\\u2019s completely all right to ask the user for more information. Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\\n\\nThe format for the askuser <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>user::askuser(askuser=\\\"$ASK_USER_INPUT\\\")</function_call>.\\n\\n\\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\\n\\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe user input is <question>I have a userid 2, do a booking of trip to Paris at 24 may 2024 by plane.</question>\\n\\n\\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\\n\\nTo answer this question, I will:\\n\\n1.

IMPORTANT: the functions provided within the examples should not be assumed to have been provided to you to use UNLESS they are also explicitly given to you within <functions></functions> tags below. All of the values and information within the examples (the questions, function results, and answers) are strictly part of the examples and have not been provided to you.\\n\\nNow that you have read and understood the examples, I will define the functions that you have available to you to use. Here is a comprehensive list.\\n\\n<functions>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId}</function_name>\\n<function_description>Retrieves user name and surname based on provided userID</function_description>\\n<required_argument>userId (string): Unique identifier of the user.</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Successful response with user details</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>POST::book-trip::/bookTrip</function_name>\\n<function_description>Allows a user to book a trip by providing necessary details.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>name (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>destination (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>date_of_trip (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>surname (string):</required_argument>\\n<required_argument>transport_type (string):</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Booking confirmation response</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>user::askuser</function_name>\\n<function_description>Ask a user when you don't have parameter values for a function</function_description>\\n<required_argument>askuser (string): The information to ask from user</required_argument>\\n<returns>string: The information received from user</returns>\\n</function>\\n<function>\\n<function_name>GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_CMNZBRGMLX::Search</function_name>\\n<function_description>Here is information about general terms for trips by bus and airplane.</function_description>\\n<required_argument>searchQuery (string): A natural language query with all the necessary conversation context to query the search tool</required_argument>\\n<returns>object: Returns string  related to the user query asked.</returns>\\n<raises>object: The predicted knowledge base doesn't exist. So, couldn't retrieve any information</raises><raises>object: Encountered an error in getting response from this function. Please try again later</raises>\\n</function>\\n\\n</functions>\\n\\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\\n\\nIf you are unsure of what one or more of the inputs to a function call should be, it\\u2019s completely all right to ask the user for more information. Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\\n\\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\\n\\nThe format for the askuser <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>user::askuser(askuser=\\\"$ASK_USER_INPUT\\\")</function_call>.\\n\\n\\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\\n\\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\\n\\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling GET::get-user-details::/getUserDetails/{userId} with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\\n\\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe user input is <question>I have a userid 2, do a booking of trip to Paris at 24 may 2024 by plane.</question>\\n\\n\\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\\n\\nTo answer this question, I will:\\n\\n1.
